It is odd how pro-lifers are often meat-eaters with no regard for life they habitually take from fully-developed, intelligent creatures like pigs--meat isn't a requirement to live. On the other hand, vegans are often pro-choice with no regard for developing fetuses. Of course, religion plays a large role in it, but it seems there is an enormous amount of group think caused by our two-party system.

Similarly, those who are pro-life do not consider the millions who grow up in horrible conditions because abortion wasn't an option, which causes them to be destined to a life of crime and lead to deaths of others and themselves by suicide. People always define suicide to be an instant event, but a type of suicide is constantly occurring when lower-socioeconomic people are pushed into conditions where they no longer give importance to their life and smoke, drink, drunk drive, over-eat, etc. When you consider that, being pro-life can actually end up being a cause of an enormous amount of suffering and death. Religious people are generally the ones who believe everything happens for a reason (fate) according to god, yet when it come to criminals there is a false belief that only free will led them to crime.
