According to the documentation of ImageMagick I suggest to use -geometry x600, whereas x600 means that the new image has a heigth of 600 px with the same aspect ratio as the old image.

For a single image you could run:

convert input.png -geometry x275 output.png
If you prefer to convert all images of a folder in one run, switch to it (i.e. cd ~/Pictures/panoramas/) and use

mogrify -geometry x275 *.jpg
But be careful with that, because it overwrites the original image files.
